    contains other GameObjects. GameObjects can form a tree structured. The engine start the drawing and update from a root
    GameObject. Draws and Updates are made in pre-order. Objects on leafs are the last to be drewn and updated.

    Behavior: Objects that add behaviors to GameObjects
        start
        update
        draw
        onCollision

    Engine: do the game loop, and control the lifecycle of the GameObject tree. Holds an EventBus.

    EventBus: provides event-based communication between GameObjects. Used by keyboard and mouse events.
